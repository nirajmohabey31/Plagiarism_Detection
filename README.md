# Plagiarism_Detection

This project is a Python-based plagiarism detection system that aims to detect potential plagiarism in text documents. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity to compare documents and identify similar content. This project can be useful for educational institutions, content creators, and researchers to detect potential plagiarism in documents and maintain academic integrity.

## Features

#### Document comparison: The system compares documents by calculating the cosine similarity between their vector representations, which are generated using NLP techniques.
#### Customizable threshold: Users can customize the similarity threshold to define what percentage of similarity should be considered as potential plagiarism.
#### Preprocessing options: The system provides different preprocessing options such as stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming, which can be configured based on user requirements.
#### Easy-to-use interface: The system provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to easily input documents, configure options, and view results.
